To run the code in Linux,or other terminals.
(Make sure you have python3 installed).

>>>Git clone this tool.
>>>cd encryptdecrypt
>>>Python3 textdress.py


*note no library functions are needed.
It encrypts text data ,it does not follow any recognised encrytion scheme so you can decrypt text data only using this program.
All the input data has to be in lowercase (working on it )
next updates will deal with importing textfiles,directly to terminal.
There are three level of encryption possible.(use 2nd and 3rd level of encryption)
feel free to contact if you find any difficulties,
