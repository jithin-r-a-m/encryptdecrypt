My first project
*note no library functions are needed.
It encrypts text data ,it does not follow any recognised encrytion scheme so you can decrypt you text data only using this program.
All the input data has to be in lowercase (working on it )
next updates will deal with importing textfiles,directly to terminal.
There are three level of encryption possible.(use 2nd and 3rd level of encryption)
feel free to contact if you find any difficulties,
